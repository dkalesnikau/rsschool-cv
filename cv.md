## About me
Programming is part of my hobbies. My main hobby is chemistry and radio electronics (HAM radio, sci-tech devices). 
I have some experience in repairing and developing electronic devices. Including for the purposes of scientific research, and I can also conduct research work myself.

I am a chemist-researcher-teacher by first profession. And a software engineer for the second (development of applied software).
Has over 10 years of teaching experience.

I want to learn modern web application development techniques.

At the moment I think that I would like to make my hobby as a form of my main activity.
